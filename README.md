# MNIST---numpy-tf-keras-pytorch

The project is intended to compare the implementation of a multi-class classification (and the different performances) for the MNIST Dataset using different low-level and high-level libraries.

The same classification task is tackled using deep neural networks built respectively with Numpy, TensorFlow, Keras and Pytorch.

The work is ongoing and it will be ready in few days hopefully :)
